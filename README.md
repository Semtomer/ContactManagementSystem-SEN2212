PROJECT DETAILS    
The Contact Management System is a Java-based mobile application designed to help users organize and manage their contacts efficiently. This project will utilize two data structures: Binary Search Tree and Ordered Linked List. Users can add, edit, and delete contacts, which will be organized alphabetically using a binary search tree data structure. Each contact will store information such as name, phone number, email address, and other relevant details. The system will allow users to search for contacts by name, phone number, or email address. Searching will be optimized using a tree data structure, providing efficient retrieval of contact information. Users canmanage groups to categorize contacts (e.g., friends, family, colleagues). Contacts can be assigned to a single group, and users can easily view and manage contacts within each group. Group management will be implemented using a ordered linked list data structure.
